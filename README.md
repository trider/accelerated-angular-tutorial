# Accelerated Angular

Over the course of my series Node JS Express for FrontEnd Developers and Rapid React, I've developed a great format for web development tutorials. Accelerated Angular now applies this format to Angular. 

In this series, I will show you how to get started with Angular and use it to build your own web applications. As with my previous series, I will be providing sample code and a GitHub repository with working examples for each installment. Here is a list of each installment.
