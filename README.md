# Accelerated Angular

Over the course of my series Node JS Express for FrontEnd Developers and Rapid React, I've developed a great format for web development tutorials. Accelerated Angular now applies this format to Angular. 

In this series, I will show you how to get started with Angular and use it to build your own web applications. As with my previous series, I will be providing sample code and a GitHub repository with working examples for each installment. Here is a list of each installment.

* [Part 1](https://github.com/trider/accelerated-angular-tutorial/tree/2f32d2669ccba0f3b19b00552c85ba11a437a975/ng-task-tutorial-01 "ng-task-tutorial-01"): Getting Started
* [Part 2]( ""): TBD
