* [Part 2](https://github.com/trider/ng-task-tutorial/tree/main/ng-task-tutorial-02 "ng-task-tutorial-02"): Angular for React Developers Part Two: User Interaction and Forms
* [Part 3](https://github.com/trider/ng-task-tutorial/tree/main/ng-task-tutorial-03 "ng-task-tutorial-03"): Angular for React Developers Part Three: Components and Presenting Data
